# Replenish++ 🌾

Auto-replant plugin for Paper/Purpur/Folia. You break a crop, it goes back in the ground. That's basically it. Stole the idea from Hypixel's Replenish because I got tired of replanting by hand.

![Preview](assets/output.webp)

## What it does

- Replants Wheat, Carrots, Potatoes, Nether Wart, Cocoa, and Beetroots automatically
- Immature crops stay at whatever growth stage they were at
- Eats a seed from your inventory on mature harvest (can turn this off)
- Can pipe drops straight into your inventory instead of the ground (also toggleable)
- You actually need the right tool in hand. No hoe, no replant. Cocoa needs an axe.
- Cocoa gets replanted facing the right direction, which was annoying to get right
- Fortune works like normal
- Sounds are fully configurable, or you can just mute them all
- Built to not choke on big farms. There's a per-tick replant cap you can tune.

## Install

1. JAR goes in `plugins/`
2. Start the server
3. Poke at `plugins/Replenish/config.yml` if you want
4. You're done

## What happens by default (no config changes)

**Mature crop:**
- Replants as a newly planted crop (age 0 / just planted)
- Takes 1 seed from your inventory/off-hand (if `requirePlayerSeed: true`)
- Drops go to you directly (if `directPickup: true`)

**Immature crop:**
- Replants at the same age it was. No seed needed.

## Contributions

PRs are disabled on this repo, not because I don't want your help but because managing them gets overwhelming, and I'd rather not ghost people. Open an issue instead, feature ideas, bugs, optimizations, whatever. We'll talk it out there.

That said, fork it, clone it, tear it apart, rebuild it weird. Make the thing *you* want to make. Everyone starts somewhere and you're goated. Go start now.
